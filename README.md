##Whats in this fork

This fork is very close to the orginal gem. I have added a few features and shortcut methods;

    Highrise::Person.url_for(123)
    Highrise::Person.find(123).phone_number
    
###Tag methods 
    Highrise::Tag.delete_by_name('tag_name')
    Highrise::Person.tagged_with_name('tag_name')
    Highrise::Person.find(123).tagged?('tag_name')
    
###Email methods
    Highrise::Person.find(123).email_address
    Highrise::Person.find(123).email #alias for email_address 
    Highrise::Person.find(123).email_valid?
 
###Highrise Custom Fields - read and write (called "subject_datas" in the Highrise API)

    p = Highrise::Person.find(123)
    p.subject_data_hash #{"favourite_color"=>"red"}
    p.field("FavouriteColor") #<Highrise::SubjectData:0xb5e3442c @attributes={"subject_field_label"=>"FavouriteColor", "id"=>12065552, "value"=>"red", "subject_field_id"=>123}, @prefix_options={}>
    p.set_field_value("FavouriteColor","blue")
    p.save

## What is it?

    Account, Comment, Company, Deal, DealCategory, Email, Group, Case, Membership, Note, Party, Person, Recording, Subject, Tag, Task, TaskCategory and User.

All these classes are inherited from ActiveResouce::Base. Refer to the [ActiveResouce][ar] documentation for more information.
